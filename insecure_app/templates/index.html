<p>
    This mini Flask application is purpose-built to demonstrate two classic SQL injection
    vulnerabilities. Explore the pages below to see how unsanitised input can break security.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Login Demo:</strong> Shows how an attacker can bypass authentication using the OR trick.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Demo:</strong> Highlights a UNION SELECT attack that reveals data from another table.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each page displays the raw SQL generated for your request so you can trace exactly how the attack works.
    In real systems you must always use parameterised queries or an ORM to avoid these issues.
